# CV App

A React App to build CVs.

## Project Description

This project is a refactoring of the previous cv-maker App. I coded the previous cv-maker project using class constructors because I am aware I will encounter Class components often in the code bases I'll be working on and although I learned to directly use functional components in React I believe it's good to do both.

Knowing the previous version was more of a Class components practice exercise I didn't focus too much on the UI. I will polish the UI of this project more and include it in my portfolio.
